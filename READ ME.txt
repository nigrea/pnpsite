Hi Eloomi

It's been a while since I wrote this, 
so I'm not completetly sure about deployment on your system.

Remember to migrate the database.

I have it in my www directory on wamp and 
I use the "php artisan serve" command to make it accessable on 
localhost:8000/

It's currently lacking an index page, so go directly to 
"localhost:8000/games".

Here are some other urls that are hard to access without and index page:


"/games"
"/tags"
"/gamesystems"

"/auth/login"
"/auth/logout"

"/auth/register"

The UI is horrible, but functional.

Best Regards Phillip Barth
